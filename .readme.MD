Getting started

Download the latest version as a zip file
Or use a package manager...
Bower: bower install lightbox2 --save
NPM: npm install lightbox2 --save

Open up the zip file and take a peek at the barebones, working example that is included in the /examples folder.

Ready to set Lightbox up on your page? Start by including the Lightbox CSS and Javascript. You can grab both these files from the /dist folder.

Include the CSS at the top of your page in your <head> tag:
<link href="path/to/lightbox.css" rel="stylesheet">
Include the Javascript at the bottom of your page before the closing </body> tag:
<script src="path/to/lightbox.js"></script>
Make sure jQuery, which is required by Lightbox, is also loaded.

If you already use jQuery on your page, make sure it is loaded before lightbox.js. jQuery 1.7 or greater is required.
If you are not currently using jQuery, I've created a packaged file that includes both Lightbox and jQuery. Include dist/js/lightbox-plus-jquery.js instead of lightbox.js.
Confirm that the four images loaded by lightbox.css are in the correct location. You can grab the images from the /dist/images folder.
Initialize with HTML

Add a data-lightbox attribute to any image link to enable Lightbox. For the value of the attribute, use a unique name for each image. For example:
<a href="images/image-1.jpg" data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="My caption">Image #1</a>
Optional: Add a data-title attribute if you want to show a caption.
If you have a group of related images that you would like to combine into a set, use the same data-lightbox attribute value for all of the images. For example:
<a href="images/image-2.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip">Image #2</a>
<a href="images/image-3.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip">Image #3</a>
<a href="images/image-4.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip">Image #4</a>
